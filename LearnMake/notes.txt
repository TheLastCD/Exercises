MakeFile layout
	targets: prerequisites
		command
		command
		command

so given:
	hello:
		echo "Hello, World"

	hello is the target
	there are no prerequisite
	echo... is the command

or:
	blah: blah.c
		gcc blah.c -o blah


	blah is the target
	blah.c is the prerequisite
	gcc .. is the command
	importantly if we run make and then run it again we will get an error as make has determined that blah.c is the same binary as the output blah
	but if we change something in blah.c it will run as expected as they are different
