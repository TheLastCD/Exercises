in this example we attempt to make a test binary but require test.o to execute,
so make will look for test.o in the makefile and run that
then it will attempt to make the final test binary now that test.o has been compiled.

this is useful as we can build .o files and only need to recompile the one that changes ie:
	src/
		main.c
		count.c
		number.c
	
	if we compile this it will make those .o files and then compile the binary.
	if we run again, we get the usual makefile unchanged error,
	if we then change something in number.c on number.c is recompiled and then the final binary is ran
	very cute
